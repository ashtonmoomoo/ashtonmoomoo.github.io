        <p class="role mm">Software Engineer II</p>
        <p class="mm">Uncommon Purpose</p>
        <p class="mm">April 2022 - present</p>
        <p>
          Working as a consultant in a cross functional team to build and maintain bespoke software projects.
          Within the team, strong emphasis is placed on automated testing, peer review, following best practices,
          collaboration, communication, and pragmatism.
          <br />
          The main project worked on in this time was to take a legacy Ruby on Rails application and re-implement it
          alongside a newer, existing application.
          Worked across the technical stack, but generally focussed on the React frontend written in TypeScript, and the
          front-of-the-backend GraphQL server, also written in TypeScript.

          Spent most of my time at Traction working with Fonterra in a cross functional team of consultants in their

          delivering code to production in a timely, and repeatable way.
